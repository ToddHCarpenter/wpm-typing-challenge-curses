I am jsut someone who likes to code and also would like to get a job programing. 
Brown fox jumped over the dark brown dog or something like that. I don't know.
Everyday I try to practice code to get better and everyday I feel that I am getting better. 
Who knew that learning could be fun. All it takes is that little push to get over the hump.
